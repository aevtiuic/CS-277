# Arduino History Device

This is a small arduino project I created for a high school AP class.

The step by step creation of this project goes as follows.

I needed a project which was able to be presented within 1 minute, and would be able to convey the names, flags, and a fact about at least 10 countries within that time.

To accomplish this, I decided to use an LED display shield to be able to convey all of that information.

I mounted it to an Arduino R3, and wrote some simple code in the update function, which caused it to cycle between a flag, then the name and fact simultaneously.

After finalizing the code, I bought a small plastic case and cut open the top, allowing room for the microcontroller.

I then inserted it and mounted the screen on top.

To power it, I took a 4x AA battery pack and wired it to the arduino, activated with a switch that connects to an electrical relay.

When powered on, the code automatically runs from the arduinos ROM, as it saves even when powered off.
